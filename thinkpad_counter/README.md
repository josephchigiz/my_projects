# ThinkPad Counter

- Fixing my daily awkward library walk with JavaScript! 👨‍💻  

## Overview
- Tired of the awkward stares during my daily walk to the favorite library spot with my trusty Lenovo ThinkPad T440, I decided to code a solution – the [ThinkPad Counter](https://thinkpad-counter.netlify.app/). This tiny project was born out of my JavaScript learning adventure, aiming to make that 30-second walk more tolerable.  

## Features
- **Tally ThinkPads:** A web app crafted with HTML, vanilla CSS, and JavaScript, allowing me to count ThinkPads in the library with a simple button tap.
- **Responsive Layout:** Enjoy the counter on any device – it's responsive and designed for seamless usage, even on mobile.

### JavaScript Tip
Replaced the initial use of the `.innerText` property with `.textContent` for improved content retrieval. Unlike `.innerText`, `.textContent` captures all HTML element content, including spaces at the end. **Small tweak, big impact!**

### Deployment
The project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/josephchigiz/my_projects/tree/master/thinkpad_counter) and deployed with [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/).

### How to Use
- Use the [ThinkPad Counter](https://thinkpad-counter.netlify.app/) web app.  
**OR**  
- Clone the repository.  
- Open `index.html` in your preferred browser.  
- Start tapping away to count whatever you want!
